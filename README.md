# Contact Form

This is a simple website contact form built with HTML, PHP, and JavaScript.

## Installation

To incorporate this contact form into your website, add [contact-form.js](contact-form.js), [contact-form.php](contact-form.php), and [contact.php](contact.php) to your website files. You will also need to sign up for a Google reCAPTCHA API key pair. Once you have received your site key and secret, add the site key to contact.php where the YOURSITEKEY placeholder is and the secret to contact-form.php where the YOURSECRET placeholder is. Finally, add the recipient email address to contact-form.php where the EMAIL placeholder is. You should now have a functional website contact form!
